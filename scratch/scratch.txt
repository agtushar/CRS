SIC210

- testbench covering all possible cases: CORNER CASES in particular

- components - VOQ, arbiter, testbench (multiple verifications!!)

- what is the value of n? vhdl provides a facility for generic data type
  vhdl also provides a facility for 2d dimensional data types
- confirm number of clock cycles required for output?
or why doesn't it matter?

- put high on outport-data-av when the data is available on the output port
- ?? read data from outport-data-rd
- what is 'exp' the abbreviation of? express
- outport, exp-data, buf-data, output,
- exp-data: input
- difference between exp-data and buf-data: high priority to exp-data,
  while contending for output port
- send data to output-data
- what do we do on rst? set all output ports to 0.

- what is the significance of output_port_valid?
  consider the output_port only if output_port_valid [is high]

- when exp_data_av (for a particular output port) [is high]
    allocate all resources to exp_data (of that output port)

- as soon as data arrives at any of the input ports,
    move it into the VOQs

- at the VOQ, run the arbiter, giving higher priority to exp-data
- confirm: arbiter would have 2n input ports
  -- internal design does not matter?

- ???? reading packets: data_valid bit every 8 bits; spread across time,
  or space
- ?? VOQ: reading output_ports: 0-indexed, 1-indexed?
- ?? VOQ/arbiter: number of packets to buffer, and drop



- ?? significance of exp-data and net neutrality
